Scenario
As a Boot Camp Instructor. I wish to creat a timed quiz on CSS fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my student's progress compared to their peers.

Functionality:
A student begins to take the test

Then they click a start button to begin the test.

Then a timer starts and they presented with a question

When they answer a question incorrectly

If they guess correctly then they will get points.

The quiz is over

They are then given the option to save their information to join the leaderboard.git
